Polystyrene-QD preform fabrication:

# Chemicals and apparatus needed:

1. 10 mL of purified styrene 
2. Washed precipitated desired amount of QDs
3. 60 mg of benzoyl peroxide as polymerization initiator
4. 16 mm x 150 mm glass test tube with a fitting airtight septum
5. Fume hood
6. Oven
7. Ultrasonic bath 
8. Venturi pump : filtering flask connected to a vacuum ejector on the water tap
9. Nitrogen gas flow
10. Two syringe needles
11. Mineral oil bath 
12. Hexane 

# Methods:
1. Add 1.5 ml of purified styrene to the small centrifuge tube of precipitated QDs.
2. Hold the tube in an ultrasonic bath for 1 minute to improve QDs dispersion.
3. Pour the mixture into the glass test tube.
4. Repeat the previous 3 steps to rinse QDs out of the centrifuge tube.
5. Pour rest of the styrene  in the test tube.
6. Add 60 mg of benzoyl peroxide to the tube.
7. Hold the tube in an ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds to dissolve benzoyl peroxide completely.
8. Close the test tube with an airtight septum.
9. Purge nitrogen into the liquid for one minute using a needle and put another needle inside the tube just above the liquid.
10. Make the glass tube vacuum using the Venturi pump (10 minutes) keeping the needle above the liquid level.
11. Keep the glass tube in a mineral oil bath using a holder.
12. Place the oil bath containng glass tube inside the oven.
13. Set temperature of the oven of 80Â°C for 24 h. Open the exhaust pipe valve connected with the oven.
14. After cooling down to room temperature, take out the glass tube from oil bath and close the exhaust pipe valve.
15. Wrap the glass tube with a soft cotton cloth and break it using a small hammer carefully.
